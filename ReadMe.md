# Sudoku Solver

In this tutorial, you will create an automatic Sudoku puzzle solver using OpenCV, Deep Learning, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

My Brother is a huge Sudoku nerd. Every time we travel, 
whether it be a 45-minute flight from 
Philadelphia to Albany or a 6-hour 
transcontinental flight to California, 
he always has a Sudoku puzzle with him.

One day he then lectured me for 20 minutes 
on how she only solves “level 4 and 5 
puzzles,” followed by a lesson on 
the “X-wing” and “Y-wing” techniques to 
Sudoku puzzle solving.
